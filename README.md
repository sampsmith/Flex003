# Parallel Detector Quality Control System

## Overview
This is a real-time industrial vision-based quality control system designed for detecting defects on pallet production lines. The system integrates PLC-controlled relay hardware, multi-camera vision setups, and custom backend software with a GUI for live monitoring and defect logging.

*Note: Source code is not shared due to intellectual property and company confidentiality.*

## Key Features
- Parallel multi-camera detection (hardware-triggered and timed cameras)
- Real-time YOLO-based defect detection (nail detection and board alignment)
- Custom GUI built with PySide6 for live visualization and control
- Relay control via serial port for defect handling
- Integrated fault history database with filtering and CSV export
- Camera recovery logic and robust error handling
- GPU and CPU compatible
